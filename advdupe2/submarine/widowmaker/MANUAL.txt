PROJECT 658 "WIDOWMAKER" BALLISTIC MISSILE SUBMARINE
Version 1.0

Notes: 
- Submarine and missiles are optimized for gm_harbor map, other maps may require tweaking of variables in e2 chips
- Missiles are prototypes and may have problems flying at targets that are not at least halfway across the map

Required:
- Sprops
- Spacebuild/CAF for life support
- Gbombs5 for nuclear warheads 

OPERATINGS OF SUBMARINE
    W for throttle increase
    S for throttle decrease
    A/D for turning
    Space for dive
    Shift to surface
    Turn on air compressor while on surface to generate oxygen, will automatically shut off while dived
